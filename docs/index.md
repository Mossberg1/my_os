# My OS

This is a hobby operating system project. The goal is to learn about operating system development by building a small kernel from scratch.
The goal is to have support for multiple architectures, add userspace, custom programming language, games, posix compliance, and be able to play DOOM.

This documentation provides an overview of the project, its architecture, and how to build and run it.

## Where to start?

*   To learn how to build and run the project, see the [Build and Run](build_and_run.md) page.
*   To understand the overall architecture of the OS, see the [Architecture Overview](architecture/overview.md).
*   To dive into the details of the kernel, see the [Kernel](kernel/boot.md) section.
